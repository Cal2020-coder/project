        <h3>Hi All,</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Oai Tran and I am the creater of this webpage. The goal of
          this webpage is to share what I learned and hope these materials here
          will help you in your economics classes. Noticed that this is my
          personal experiences, which does not speak to all. I just want to
          share what I known and hope that it would help those that are taking
          lower-division economics classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little bit about me: I am a transfer student, who graduated with an
          Economics degree B.A. from University of California - Berekeley
          (UC-Berekeley or Cal). Before I came to Cal, I had attended a few
          community colleges such as CoastLine, SaddleBack then Chabot College.
          While in Community Colleges, I took basic classes and never thought
          about apply to any University; nonetheless, I did it simply because
          one of my teacher at Chabot college had no hope in the students and
          kinda look down on the Economics degree from UC. I was told that I
          need to talk all the math and CS classes if I was to think about
          appling. I guess it partly true that having a strong math background
          and CS would help you. I mean it would help you in anything in life
          pretty much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Economics is not hard, what hard is that professors did not break down
          the materials in a more simplier terms or real life examples. This is
          extremely true in lower-dicision classes. Where you learn theories and
          terms that you have no ideas what they are talking about. Here, this
          webpage. I hope to undo exactly that. I will define the terms,
          translated to everyday english, give examples, then graph them. I hope
          this approach will help you understand more about what Economics and
          be able to understand what you read or see on the news.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the last note- I hope to learn more from you also. Please email if
          you have any question and I am also doing tutor if you need any help.
          I do understand that there are a lot of vidoes and website out there
          about the topics. Use this as one of the 1000 tools, and continue
          learning.
